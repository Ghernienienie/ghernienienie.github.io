                      I first joined the Basketball CCA for 1 year in Primary 2.
                      Despite the thrill and excitement for each and every dribble
                      of the ball, I came to a conclusion that competitive sport
                      was not my forte.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      I preferred somewhere where I can be more expressive, where
                      I can feel heightened senses while still being relaxed.
                      Having that in mind, I explored and waited to stumble upon
                      that oasis.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      On one dim and breezy afternoon, my ears captured a sound -
                      so loud, yet so serene. While the musical bridge of sound
                      waves were still strong, I tracked the source of the sound;
                      and when I had discovered the source, I observed a man, in
                      tears, grasping his rod-like instrument tightly, as though
                      he was hugging it and expressing his emotions in it. My
                      inspiration bloomed.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Eagerly, I rushed towards the musical co-curricular
                      activities' venues in my school and broke an entry into a
                      live room that smelled of pungent brass. A man with a baton
                      and his band of young musicians halt, staring at me with
                      shock. With shame, I apologized. As I turned a hundred and
                      eighty degrees from their direction, a resonating "wait"
                      from the man lingered in the room. At that moment, I had
                      accepted my fate - I am doomed. "Would you like to try to
                      play an instrument?", he announced. From then on, my life
                      changed forever.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Though I started off with the band at later time than the
                      majority of the players, I was able to catch up surprisingly
                      swift. I always looked forward to the practices that we had.
                      I held my horn in e-flat from the moment I joined the
                      <i>brass band</i>
                      to the very graduation day where my last rhapsody took off.

                      Initially, I wanted to switch path from the musical world to
                      the digital world; I first wanted to join the school's
                      <q>Infocomm Club</q> - which is a co-curricular activity
                      involving photography, video-graphy and digital editing -
                      which I had passion for. <br /><br />
                      On the CCA's try out day held in my school, the queue for
                      audition to join the club stretched from the interviewer all
                      the way across the school's hall, which is jaw-droppingly
                      long, that queue was the barrier. Had I waited, time for my
                      audition would be insufficient.
                      <br /><br />
                      I decided to rejoin a band. This time, it was
                      <i>Symphonic Band</i>. Disappointment never came to my
                      attention since. My new partner was the Trombone, and I
                      would carry and perform with it in our school's as well as
                      external events. <br /><br />
                      It was only until Secondary 3 when I had to trade my
                      Trombone for the Trumpet due to the band's lack of players.
                      It was mainly because of a due performance coming in a
                      month's time that made me volunteered to play it. My
                      consistency and adaptability enabled me to play the Trumpet
                      with a pleasant tone during the Singapore's Youth Band
                      Festival of 2019.
                      <br /><br />
                      It was always obvious that my peers, seniors and juniors
                      admired my commitment to the band. I loved being the best
                      example that I could be to them, and more. As a result, I
                      was often elected the proclaimed busiest roles in the band.
                      <br /><br />
                      I was first appointed as a Quarter Master in Secondary 2 to
                      3, which is a manager for the logistics matter of the band,
                      and this mainly includes ordering of instrumental
                      accessories and checking of instruments to send for
                      maintenance. I had introduced many novelties in planning
                      such as starting an excel sheet for the logistics instead of
                      sticking to the traditional black and white of a pen.
                      <br /><br />
                      My responsibility in that role lead me to being the Drum
                      Major of the band in Secondary 3 to 4, which was proclaimed
                      the role of a disciplinarian and administrator in my band.
                      <br /><br />
                      Highlights of me in this role includes similarities as when
                      I was in the QM role; I also introduced admired novelties in
                      the band and established clean and standardized information
                      regarding every administrative matter of the band including
                      the specific duties of every role holder in the band, as
                      well as instructions on what and how to execute their
                      duties.
                      <br /><br />
                      I left a legacy of being: an extremely committed individual
                      of the band; being the first student to conduct a National
                      Day Parade (whom previously were teachers); being the
                      student who learned the trumpet within a month, and finally
                      having established structured rules and procedures for the
                      band.
